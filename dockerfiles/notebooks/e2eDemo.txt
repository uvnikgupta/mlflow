1.  Start postgres pod
2.  Start minio pod
	logon to minio @ localhost:30009 and create a bucket named mlruns
3.  Start mlflow server pod
	logon to mlflow server @ localhost:30005 and delete the default experiment
4.  Start mltoolkit pod
	logon to the jupyter notebook hosted by mltoolkit pod @ localhost:30008
	execute the notebook
	from the mlflow server check the data path and other parameters
	from the mlflow server register the model as linreg and promote it to staging
5.  Start the mlflow linreg serving pod
6.  Open the pipeline_serving notebook and execute it to get the inference from the serving pod
7.  In the mltoolkit jupyter notebook change the data version to 2 and execute the notebook
8.  In the mlflow server UI observe the new run
9.  Restart the mlflow linreg serving pod
10. Execute the inference code in pipeline serving notebook and notice the difference in rmse value
